<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Prince Nkosi, a name with royal roots in Zulu, hailing from the small town of Mbombela where my passion for business took root. 
  Inspired by legends like Martin Luther King and Nelson Mandela, I believe true leadership is about empowering people to find their own path to success. 
  With a vision that extends beyond the self, effective leadership demands boldness and fearlessness, guiding organizations to the "promise land.
